v1.5.0
01/24/2025

NEW FEATURES
  - AlphaFold3 updated with v3.0.1

v1.4.0
01/13/2025

NEW FEATURES
  - AlphaFold3
  - Bootstrap using Docker containers on Docker Hub 4geniac

BUGFIXES
  - Remove double-quotes for boolean parameter in json files
  - Numpy forced to version 1.26.4 in nanoBERT container

DOCUMENTATION
  - Detail outputs and explain how the different annotations must be installed

v1.3.0
11/20/2024

NEW FEATURES
  - AFMassive:
    * All the models are computed in parallel
    * A process has been added to compute relaxation
  - AlphaFill:
    * tool to predict the binding of missing compounds to predicted 3D protein structure
    * multiqc report with the predictions
    * take into account that the json output can include different value for the same transplant, or some transplant may have missing information
  - DynamicBind:
    * Add test data
  - New tools:
    * nanoBERT: predict the nanobody mutational space
    * DiffDock: molecular docking
  - Result folder:
    * organize publishDir for AlphaFold and AfMassive in order to avoid three folder levels.
  - Structure prediction with multimer:
    * compute metrics pDockQ and iPAE
  - Process:
    * Generate PAE matrix in JSON format for the best model
  - multiqc reports:
    * legends and references have been added in the reports
    * proteinStruct includes the ranking_debug.json table and multimer metrics (when available) for all models
    * new option to generate reports from existing results:
      --htmlProteinStruct
    * PAE plots: max value set to 31.75
    * fasta sequence is displayed at the beginning of the report
    * Mosaic plot with all 3D structures
    * In the plots, model name legend which contains rank start from 0 (instead of 1) to be consistent with the naming produced by AlphaFold
  - code refactoring:
    * implementation of nextflow subworkflows
    * ensure that the pipeline can resume
    * adaptive memory for metricsMultimer process
    * pylint / shellcheck scripts, rename in-house script with ap_ prefix
    * set PATH in container recipes
    * process and files related to multiqc hhave been renamed with mqc

v1.2.0
03/08/2024

NEW FEATURES
  - AFMassive:
    * massiveFold has been renamed by AFMassive
    * --dropout set as default in --afMassiveOptions
  - AlphaFold:
    * memory has been increased for both alphaFoldSearch and alphaFold processes
  - ColabFold:
    * use --save-all option to save pickle files
    * --colabSearchHelp option
    * add amber relaxation by default
  - DynamicBind:
    * tool for molecular docking
  - multiqc reports
    * plots
    * print software version from containers (get_version.sh)
  - Groovy functions moved from main.nf to lib/function.nf
  - add stub section in process for dry-run with -stub-run

BUG FIXES
  - change regex to get protein name from fasta filename
